## About the Project:

Problem : Customer segmentation
- [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

Implementation: I have taken inspiration from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data), and implemented in Tensorflow 2.0, and have deployed it using Flask application.

Task :

- Analyzing the content of the E-Commerce database that contains the purchases made by approximate ~4000 customers over a period of one year
- To develop a model that allows to anticipate or predict the purchases that will be made by a new customer during the following & this year, based on the data available from the previous purchases.
Steps :

- Data Preparation
- Exploring the content of variables (in short, Exploratory Data Analysis, not inlcuding the product category)
- Intuitions about the categories of the product, the customer buys
- Categories of the Customer that buys the product
- Classifying the Customers based on some parameters
- Testing the Predictions
